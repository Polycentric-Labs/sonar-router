# AI assistance in sonar-router's development

Last updated: 2026-09-06. Disclosure level: **ai-assisted** (human work completed
with AI assistance and reviewed by the maintainer before it ships).

This page records how AI tools take part in building sonar-router. The skill
runs inside an AI assistant by design, since Claude Code invokes it to choose
a research tool; this page is about how the skill itself was developed,
separate from that runtime behavior.

## What the maintainer does

- Sets scope, priorities and design, and decides what ships and when.
- Reviews every change before it lands, and performs every publish step
  personally (commits and merges to `main`).
- Writes the security dispositions, licence decisions and public statements.

## Where AI tools help

| Role in the development workflow | Tools |
|---|---|
| Coding assistants (implementation, tests, refactors, drafting docs) | Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity |
| Hosted models, reached through a router | OpenRouter |
| Local models | Mainly Qwen and Llama, others juggled based on use case |
| Research and source discovery | Perplexity, [Polycentric Labcoat](https://github.com/Polycentric-Labs/labcoat) |

The list changes as tools enter or leave the workflow; the date at the top is
the last revision.

## What is excluded

- No AI identity appears in git metadata. Commits are authored and signed by
  the maintainer, and there are no `Co-authored-by` trailers naming AI tools.
- No autonomous agent opens issues or pull requests, and none publishes
  anything.
- No AI-drafted text ships unread. Every document is reviewed and edited by
  the maintainer first.

## Contributors

External contributors may use AI tools under the rules in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md): the contributor is the author and is
accountable for the change; significant AI assistance is disclosed in the pull
request description or with an `Assisted-by:` commit trailer; `Co-authored-by`
trailers naming AI tools are not accepted.

## Organization policy

Polycentric Labs maintains one AI-assistance policy shared by its projects,
published at [polycentriclabs.com/ai-policy](https://polycentriclabs.com/ai-policy)
and mirrored in the organization's GitHub profile as
[AI_POLICY.md](https://github.com/Polycentric-Labs/.github/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md).
This page is sonar-router's project-level record under that policy.
